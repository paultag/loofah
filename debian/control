Description: debile helper to rebuild a set of existing packages
 Loofah can be used to upload a subset of the Debian archive to the
 Debile infrastructure for rebuilding. It syncs down the apt Sources
 list and places it in mongodb for fast queries. This then allows the
 user to manually run rebuilds on any source package that fits a set
 of critera (written in the form of a mongo query), which get pulled
 and uploaded by ricky.
